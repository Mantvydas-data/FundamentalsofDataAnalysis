<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This repository contains assessment for Fundamentals of Data Analysis 2021 module. Files include: requirements, gitignore, readme files and two Jupyter notebooks: one pyplot.ipynb for overview of matplotlib.pyplot Python package and second one for CAO points retrieval from the CAO website and analysis comparing differences between academic years 2019, 2020 and 2021. <br>
Assessment instructions can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/assessment-2122-funddata/raw/main/assessment.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Problem statement</h3>

<p>Create a GitHub repository containing two Jupyter notebooks - these are described further down. The repository should contain the following:</p>
<p>10% A clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is in it, and how to run the notebooks.</p>
<p>10% A requirements.txt file that enables someone to quickly run your notebooks with minimal configuration. You should also include any other required files such as data files and image files.</p>
<p><strong>Pyplot Notebook</strong></p>
<p>Include a Jupyter notebook called pyplot.ipynb that contains the following.</p>
<p>15% A clear and concise overview of the matplotlib.pyplot Python package, pitched at your classmates.</p>
<p>25% An in-depth explanation of three interesting plots from the matplotlib.pyplot Python package. You have free reign to choose the three plots yourself.</p>
<p><strong>CAO Points Notebook</strong></p>
<p>Include a Jupyter notebook called cao.ipynb that contains the following.</p>
<p>10% A clear and concise overview of how to load CAO points information from the CAO website into a pandas data frame, pitched as your classmates.</p>
<p>20% A detailed comparison of CAO points in 2019, 2020, and 2021 using the functionality in pandas.</p>
<p>10% Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers. </p>

<h3>Running the code</h3>

<p>Assignment has been completed using Python version 3.8.8 that can be downloaded <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> with Anaconda version 4.10.3 that can be downloaded <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">here</a>. While Python and related libraries-packages can be installed separately it is encouraged to use latest Anaconda distribution that provides a wide variety of data science related tools.</p>
<p>Camelot package requires dependencies to be preinstalled, OS-specific instructions should be folowed <a href="https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install-deps.html">here</a> with Camelot to be installed after by following steps listed <a href="https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install.html">here</a>
    
<p>To run the code <a href="https://github.com/Mantvydas-data/FundamentalsofDataAnalysis.git">repository</a> is to be cloned or files to be downloaded manually as Zip file by following <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">Github guide</a>. Commander of choice can be used, that will require navigation to repository download location, launching of <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/starting.html">Jupyter</a> environment in home directory of the project files saved.</p>
