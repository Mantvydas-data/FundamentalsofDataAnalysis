<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This repository contains assessment for Fundamentals of Data Analysis 2021 module. Files include: requirements, gitignore, readme files and two Jupyter notebooks: one pyplot.ipynb for overview of matplotlib.pyplot Python package and second one for CAO points retrieval from the CAO website and analysis comparing differences between academic years 2019, 2020 and 2021. <br>
Assessment instructions can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/assessment-2122-funddata/raw/main/assessment.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Problem statement</h3>

<p>Create a GitHub repository containing two Jupyter notebooks - these are described further down. The repository should contain the following:</p>
<p>10% A clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is in it, and how to run the notebooks.</p>
<p>10% A requirements.txt file that enables someone to quickly run your notebooks with minimal configuration. You should also include any other required files such as data files and image files.</p>
<p><strong>Pyplot Notebook</strong></p>
<p>Include a Jupyter notebook called pyplot.ipynb that contains the following.</p>
<p>15% A clear and concise overview of the matplotlib.pyplot Python package, pitched at your classmates.</p>
<p>25% An in-depth explanation of three interesting plots from the matplotlib.pyplot Python package. You have free reign to choose the three plots yourself.</p>
<p><strong>CAO Points Notebook</strong></p>
<p>Include a Jupyter notebook called cao.ipynb that contains the following.</p>
<p>10% A clear and concise overview of how to load CAO points information from the CAO website into a pandas data frame, pitched as your classmates.</p>
<p>20% A detailed comparison of CAO points in 2019, 2020, and 2021 using the functionality in pandas.</p>
<p>10% Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers. </p>
